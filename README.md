# Zelig Budget Tool Prototype  

<a href="http://datascience.iq.harvard.edu/tworavens"><img src="budget_tool/images/dpi2.png" align="left"></a> 
This prototype system will allow researchers with sensitive datasets to make differentially private statistics about their data available through data repositories using the [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) platform. A paper describing our system can be found on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04340.pdf).      

As an intern, I worked on the beginning stages of the interactive GUI and researched applications of differential privacy software. I collaborated with [Nabib Ahmed](anhttps://github.com/Nashmed28), and I was advised by [Dr. James Honaker](http://hona.kr/) and [Jack Murtagh](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jmurtagh).      

# The PSI (Private Data Sharing Interface)
[PSI](https://beta.dataverse.org/custom/DifferentialPrivacyPrototype/) is a system of interlocking statistical tools for data exploration, analysis, and meta-analysis.  The first to be released is an interface for quantitative analysis, that allows users at all levels of statistical expertise to explore their data, describe their substantive understanding of the data, and appropriately construct statistical models. This integrates with [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org) and the [Zelig Project](http://zeligproject.org) through a portable, lightweight, browser-based and gesture-driven interface, allowing users to run statistical models available in Zelig on data archived in Dataverse.

The demo of the [Budget Tool Interface] (https://beta.dataverse.org/custom/DifferentialPrivacyPrototype/UI/code/interface.html?fileid=20&UI=1) uses replication data from Fearon and Laitin's 2003 article *"Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War"*.    

The [Budget Tool GUI](https://beta.dataverse.org/custom/DifferentialPrivacyPrototype/UI/code/interface.html?fileid=20&UI=1) allows data depositors to:
  * select variables of interest
  * select statistics of interest
  * allocate global privacy parameters ("the privacy budget")
  * interactively view accuracy rate of statistics
  * submit privacy budget
